### Coding Experience ###

I cut my teeth on BASIC and Pascal in grade school and high school. I currently write a lot of Bash scripts and occasional Applescripts, know juuuuust enough Powershell to ask where the bathroom is, and I'm working on learning Python.

### More About Me ###

![PhillyMJS at Trinity Site Fence](trinityfence.jpg)

**üñ• Mac admin** ‚Ä¢ I've been a Mac user since 1991. After being a Tandy 1000 user from 1985, when I got my Macintosh LC it was love at first boot. A Mac has been my daily driver ever since, and I've made my living supporting Mac users since 1992.

**‚ò¢Ô∏è Atomic tourist** ‚Ä¢ Cold War history fascinates me. I've spent hours [exploring a Titan II ICBM silo](titan_ii_lcc_key.jpg) in Arizona, and I've stood at [ground zero of Trinity Site](trinity_obelisk.jpg) in New Mexico and at the [rim of Sedan Crater](sedan_crater_tour_group.jpg) in Nevada. I have a long list of other places I want to visit.

**üìñ Avid reader** ‚Ä¢ Science fiction, alternate history, computer/video game industry history, and Cold War history are my genres of choice, but I also have shelves of Tom Clancy, John Grisham, and Stephen King.

**üèÉ Less avid runner** ‚Ä¢ [I lost a lot of weight a few years ago](https://phillymjs.com/weightloss) and so far I've successfully kept off 90% of it. I ran my first 5K in late 2019, and then... pandemic. I tried a "virtual" 5K but the experience was severely lacking. Haven't really gotten back into it since in-person races became a thing again. Even if I haven't gotten out and run that much lately, though, I've still done at least an hour of cardio every single day for more than five years. 

**üëæ Retro tech fan** ‚Ä¢ I collect classic computers and video game consoles. My flagship system is the Colecovision because it was the first one I had as a kid. I still have it.
