### Coding Experience ###

I cut my teeth on BASIC and Pascal in grade school and high school. I currently write a lot of Bash scripts and occasional Applescripts, know juuuuust enough Powershell to ask where the bathroom is, and am working on learning Python.

![PhillyMJS at Trinity Site Fence](trinityfence.jpg)

**üñ• Mac admin** ‚Ä¢ I've been a Mac user since 1991. After being a Tandy 1000 user from 1985, when I got my Macintosh LC it was love at first sight. I've made my living supporting Mac users since 1992.

**‚ò¢Ô∏è Atomic tourist** ‚Ä¢ Cold War history fascinates me. I've spent hours touring a Titan ICBM silo and have stood at ground zero of Trinity Site. I have a long list of other places I want to visit.

**üìñ Avid reader** ‚Ä¢ Science fiction, alternate history, computer industry history, and Cold War history are my genres of choice, but I also have shelves of Tom Clancy, John Grisham, and Stephen King.

**üèÉ Less avid runner** ‚Ä¢ [I lost a lot of weight a few years ago](https://phillymjs.com/weightloss) and I'm trying to keep it off. I ran my first 5K in late 2019, and then... pandemic. I tried a "virtual" 5K but the experience was severely lacking. Hoping to get back into it now that in-person races are becoming a thing again.

**üëæ Retro tech fan** ‚Ä¢ I collect classic computers and video game consoles. My flagship system is the Colecovision because it was the first one I had as a kid. I still have it.
